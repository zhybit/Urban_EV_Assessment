# Project of urban EV assessments
Assessments of battery utilization and energy consumption of urban EVs. This project includes code, EV data, and metadata related to Yang Z. et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The datasets include real-world operating states of EVs during driving/charging sessions and vehicle feature data. The operating data consist of multiple features, such as the starting and ending times of driving/charging segments, SOCs, temperatures, total driving distances, charging energy of charging segments, driving distances of driving sessions, etc. The feature data consist of rated ranges, battery types, regions to which the license plates belong, etc. These data are encoded by utf-8 and it is recommended to use the python/pandas package to read csv files. Materials are partially supported by NDANEV OPENLAB.
